                I have been a database administrator for 27 years, working in the cloud, AWS, Azure, and GCP. I have also worked in physical data centers, all over the world. I have virtually been there, for the most part. I spend much of my free time learning about new technologies. This is my linked-in web <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/j79h110" target="_blank">linked-in</a>". Feel free to drop me a line if you want to talk about databases or cloud technologies.

                    I have fun with my family. This year, we decided to plow under our entire back yard (about 1/3 acre) and plant a huge garden. We only got half of the work done this year and plan to finish it by early Summer 2023. Maintaining a garden gives us a safe place, far away from the hussle and bustle of every day life, to reflect, and to help provide for ourselves and our neighbors. Our hope is that our neighbors will join us in an effort to bring our community together and have fun eating some really good food.

                    Leonardo Da Vinci said, "Where the spirit does not work with the hand, there is no art. Nature is the source of all true knowledge. She has her logic, her laws; she has no effect without cause nor invention without necessity."

                    I have always sought the same Spirit of God in my learning. I am continually amazed at the marvel and miracle of life. The human form fascinates me, and I have dedicated many years to learning anatomy and realism techniques so that I might mimic in some small way the divine nature that God places in all life.
